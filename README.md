## hangMan
<h3>The Hang Man Game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word from an array within six attempts. Players see all letters of the alphabet displayed on-screen and can click on a letter to make a guess. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the current state of the word, and the letter is disabled from further guesses. If the letter is incorrect, it is recorded as a wrong guess, and the number of remaining attempts decreases by one. The game ends when players either reveal all the letters in the word, winning the game, or exhaust their six attempts, resulting in a loss. Additionally, players can view the number of remaining attempts and a list of incorrect guesses throughout the game. </h3>
